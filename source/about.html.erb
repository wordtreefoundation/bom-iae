    <p>
      The Internet-Annotated Edition of the Book of Mormon is a public resource curated by volunteer editors from around the world. It is a critical examination of the origins of the book, with sources and references.
    </p>

    <p>
      The principle aim of the project is to shed light on the environment in which the Book of Mormon was authored, and to connect its stories, ideas, and phraseology to its early 19th century American context.
    </p>

    <p>
      We try to strike a balance between publishing new information quickly and publishing only accurate information. However, with so many sources, editors, and differing opinions, we are bound to make some mistakes. While every effort is made to ensure correctness, this is a work-in-progress and probably will be for a long time.
    </p>
